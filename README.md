which is a very handy tool to run your github workflows locally.

## Why

In the other Images I had problems with executing azure related tools, so I decided to modify a image
from [catthehacker](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images)

## :warning: Could change frequently :warning:

...so please do not use this anywhere in production
